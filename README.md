# DB_Mini_Project
## MySQL
#### A file called mysql_init.sh has been created to allow the installation and start up of MySQL. After this file is set up please run migrations.

#### If the database and the admin doesn't have the test data, please use the following data to populate the sites from the admin panel:
#### Collector notes- Collector ID 233, note: Called customer for payment.
#### Customer Transactions- Collector ID 233, amount: 200.50, date: anytime.
#### PaymentPlans- Customer ID 233, plan name: Monthly Plan, Monthly Payment: 50, Duration months: 12.

## Other notes
#### To start the installation process I would type gp validate in the terminal.
#### To get into the database I used the terminal command: mysql -u root -p --protocal=tcp
#### DEBUG is set to TRUE

## Credits

## Acknowledgements
